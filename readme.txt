Do you think that all of core needs to have REST support? This is the plugin for you!

== Description ==

Since all of WordPress core needs to benefit from the REST API, it makes sense that the most common of all WordPress plugins, Hello Dolly should also have a RESTful endpoint.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `/restful-hello-dolly/` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Access the endpoint here: /wp-json/restful-hello-dolly/v1/lyric

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this totally useless? =

No more then a RESTful file editor.

= What about create, update, and delete? =

Sorry, this plugin is limited in scope, and we don't want to railroad the features for petty things that most users don't need. Better to release quickly, so that we can gain wider adoption.
